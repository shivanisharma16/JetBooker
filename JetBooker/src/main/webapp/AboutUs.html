               <p> <b>Sajid Hussain, Pranjal Dubey, Anshul Chaurasia and Ayushi Arjariya</b>, four students, worked together on a college project to develop an Airline Reservation System. Their system allowed users to search for flights, select seats, and book tickets in a simple and intuitive manner. The team put in a lot of effort and dedication to ensure that the software was user-friendly and met all the requirements set by their professor. They also made sure that the system was robust and reliable, so that users would have a smooth experience when using it. The project was a success, and their hard work was recognized by their peers and instructors. The Airline Reservation System developed by Sajid Hussain, Pranjal Dubey, Anshul Chaurasia and Ayushi Arjariya, was a testament to their technical skills, teamwork, and passion for software development.</p>
                <p>An Airline Reservation System (ARS) is a software application that helps airlines manage their passenger bookings and flight schedules. The system helps airlines to automate and streamline their operations, making the booking process faster, more efficient, and cost-effective. With the rise of online travel agencies and e-ticketing, ARS has become an indispensable tool for airlines to manage their reservations and keep pace with the changing demands of the market.</p>
                <p>An ARS typically consists of several modules, including a flight search engine, a booking engine, a passenger management module, and a payment gateway. The flight search engine allows passengers to search for flights based on their preferred departure and arrival dates, time, and destination. The booking engine then enables passengers to select and book their preferred flight and seat. The passenger management module helps airlines to manage passenger information, including contact details, flight itineraries, and baggage allowances. The payment gateway enables passengers to make secure online payments using a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and net banking.</p>
                <p>To make the ARS more accessible and user-friendly, airlines often integrate it with their websites, allowing passengers to book flights and manage their reservations directly from the airline's website. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a popular programming language used to create web pages and develop websites. HTML tags are used to format and structure the content of a web page, making it easier to read and navigate.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, an Airline Reservation System is a crucial tool for airlines to manage their passenger bookings, flight schedules, and operations. With the integration of HTML tags, airlines can provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience for their passengers, making the booking process faster and more efficient.</p>
